                            Hello! My name is Michelle Towers, I'm 28 years old and I currently live in Bendigo, Australia. <br>
                            I was born in Alexandra, Victoria. I'm half Australian/half British; because my dad moved to Australia from England before I was born. <br><br>
                            The only language I speak at home is English, I do know some Italian but not as much as I would like! <br>
                            Highschool was bad for me, I regret not putting in more effort, however I try my best to only look forwards when possible!<br><br>
                            Due to Depression and Anxiety, my life has been on hold for a very long time; but with me starting this course, along-side Intro to Programming - I'm taking back my life! <br><br>

                            I like to play video games of all varities; my favourite however is Destiny 2. <br>
                            Other than gaming, I really love to read and to draw stuff on my iPad. <br>
                            Drawing is one of my favourite ways to be creative! I love drawing from reference. <br><br>
                            I have 3 adorable cats named Ava, Lily and Madden. I also own a dog named Blink; after my favourite band Blink-182!<br><br>
