                            <div class="info">
                            Hello! My name is Michelle Towers, I'm 28 years old and I currently live in Bendigo, Australia. <br>
                            I was born in Alexandra, Victoria. I'm half Australian/half British; because my dad moved to Australia from England before I was born. <br><br>
                            The only language I speak at home is English, I do know some Italian but not as much as I would like! <br>
                            Highschool was bad for me, I regret not putting in more effort, however I try my best to only look forwards when possible!<br><br>
                            Due to Depression and Anxiety, my life has been on hold for a very long time; but with me starting this course, along-side Intro to Programming - I'm taking back my life!  <br><br>

                            I like to play video games of all varities; my favourite however is Destiny 2. <br>
                            Other than gaming, I really love to read and to draw stuff on my iPad. <br>
                            Drawing is one of my favourite ways to be creative! I love drawing from reference. <br><br><br>
                            I have 3 adorable cats named Ava, Lily and Madden. I also own a dog named Blink; after my favourite band Blink-182!<br><br>

                            <h1>INTEREST IN IT</h1>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            <div class="info">
                            My interest in IT started when I was really little and my grandfather gifted me my first PC. He showed me what each part did and how they all worked together. <br>
                            I also was the reason that the PC broke and he helped me fix it. I was messing around with the parts, trying to figure it all out for myself. <br><br>
                            I remember that I would play Age of Empires on the pc all of the time and got in some trouble for lacking in school work! <br>
                            My nan also had a bunch of learning games that my brother and I would play all of the time too, because as a child who cares that you're learning as long as it's fun right? <br><br>
                            Building my current computer has to be my favourite memory related to IT because I was so scared of breaking something and so proud when I didn't. <br>
                            Having always been my family's go-to tech person, I've naturally over the years developed basic IT skills and exploring them more has been a goal that I've pushed aside for quite some time. Not anymore! My life is mine now. <br><br>
                            Studying at RMIT via OUA seemed like a really good option for me, as someone who's extremely shy and introverted, and my first couple of weeks studying have proven to me that
                            I am capable of doing this. <br> I plan to finish this course alongside Intro to Programming and then go even further in my studies; doing Bachelor of IT. <br><br>
                            I am extremely excited to learn more about Cyber Security and Machine Learning! These areas interest me so much. I've watched countless videos on other people <br> exploring these
                            areas and I cannot wait to do it myself. <br><br> I'm an overachiever who also hates everything that I do lmao. This leads to me obsessing until I get things perfect and I mostly always will not like the final result anyway.
                            I like this about myself though, it gives me a passion for learning as I'm always wanting to be better and to do better

                                I like the results that I received because it speaks about being responsible and enjoying attempting to make things perfect. Creating this website is the perfect example of that for me! <br><br>
                                It also speaks about how intuitive my type is with other peoples emotions, and the ability to form strong bonds; despite being an introvert and all of my experieces so far make me believe that to be true. <br><br>
                                Noteable strengths are really supportive, reliable and observant; all of which I do identify with. I did do some thinking about my patience tolerance as it's supposed to be higher than what I know it is
                                self reflection is important to me and these test results have made me think a lot. <br>
                                Noteable weaknesses are shyness, taking things too personally and overloading myself; again, all of which I really identify with. <br><br>Going forward working in a team enviroment I'm defintely going to have to
                                be cautious of my weaknesses and speak up for any help I need to overcome them. I'd prefer a closeknit and supportive team enviroment and I plan on doing my best to be a contributing factor to making that possible!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

                                </div>
                                <div class="info"><img src="learningstyle.png" alt="My results" style="width:200px;height:200px;margin-right:20px;">
                                <h2 style="color:rgb(128, 162, 163)">Learning Style</h2>
                                I had never done a test like this before and it was very insightful for me. I knew that people learn differently but had never questioned my own ability. <br>
                                Throughout schooling I defintely did notice that my learning was greater when I was up the front of the class, full attention and no one to distract me.<br><br>
                                This makes me wonder how group situations will go for me personally, in the case of other people messing around. I think I will personally step in and ask them to stop though. <br><br>
                                I hope I can also be a positive influence on other people's learning enviroments as well. I try to ask relevant questions when applicable, otherwise I doubt myself too much. Second guessing myself is one of my biggest flaws when it comes to schooling. I try my best to push through it though and defintely will continue to do so in group enviroments.<br><br>
                                Note taking, especially making it **pretty** is something I enjoy doing and I always make time each week to satisify this need. I feel like it helps me learn more; re-writing all of my notes, condensing them and sorting them how I like.<br>
                                </div>
                                <div class="info"><img src="thebig5.png" alt="My results" style="width:500px;height:200px;margin-right:20px;">
                                <h2 style="color:rgb(128, 162, 163)">The Big 5</h2>
                                I'll be honest, this test made me a bit sad to reflect on how Depression and Anxiety impacts my life and personality a ton. <br><br>
                                The test shines a light on agreeability as a good thing, which I do think it can be in small doses. I do fear however that I'm too much of a pushover. <br><br>
                                I am worried that this would reflect in my contribution to a team enviroment. For example: maybe <br><br>someone speaks over me and I'm too shy to speak again or the group wants to go in a certain direction that I believe isnt the most efficient. <br>
                                I know that I have a habit of doing this, especially in newly formed groups and it has been on my mind.<br><br>
                                I do try my best when I can to overcome these thoughts and feelings, but everyone has down days and this is again where I will need to reach out for support if I need it. I hopefully will be able to surround myself with a supportive team. <br><br>
                                All of these tests have been really insightful and though provoking. I know where I started before I took this giant step forward in my life and I do have an idea of where I want to end up. That excites me and gives me hope. <br>

                                        My ideal job would be Database & Systems Administrator. I think this is the most realistic and likely job for me, and I do think that I would perform well at this job.
                                        <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56257796?type=standout#sol=f8b2360f184eae1a23fff660ade02d4d566098eb "> Here is the job listing that I'm using as my example.</a> <br> <br>
                                        A Database Administrator is a highly skilled and experienced individual that actively maintains all database management, all software and security procedures to ensure efficient performance, stability and reliability. <br> <br>
                                        This job appeals to me because I enjoy writing, troubleshooting, learning and teaching. It seems like a good way to incorporate all of that into one role. I'm a bit of a perfectionist as well and I think that will help me thrive in this type of job. <br><br>
                                        The skills and experience required for this job are thankfully, easy to improve upon with a lot of effort and determination and that motivates me greatly. <br>
                                        Skills such as critical thinking, problem solving and the ability to keep track of multiple things at once are greatly needed. Experience usually requires a Bachelors <br>
                                        degree in any related IT field, for example; Network Security, Database design or Networking. <br><br>I'm confident in my abilities and skills currently; I think I have a good starting base.
                                        I'm willing to learn and develop a greater skillset, to benefit me in all future endeavors. I'd love to have a better understanding of Cyber Security, which would also help me greatly in the future if I choose this pathway. <br><br>
                                        To start my pathway towards this type of job I'm going to have to complete my Bachelors of IT and then either go for my Masters or do another degree that is more focused on Database networking. <br><br>
                                        Over the next 3 years, I'm looking forward to learning how to work better in team environments, developing my criticial thinking skills and learning how to troubleshoot any issues without needing to Google.  <br><br>
                                        My plan, outside of the typical learning that I will be receiving over the next couple of years is to read up on SQL, or watch videos on SQL too because it seems to be needed and I'm always willing to try to learn new things. <br>
                                        Aside from that, I enjoy watching YouTubers make 'day in my life' videos so I'm sure that I could find people in my field of interest who do share their lives like this. The internet is a great source of learning
                                        for those willing to take the step, and I am willing! <br><br> As for gaining experience, I briefly volunteered at a community center where I did do work sort of like this and I enjoyed it.
                                        I could look into volunteering there again. It was a great learning experience for me.
