                            Hello! My name is Michelle Towers, I'm 28 years old and I currently live in Bendigo, Australia. <br>
                            I was born in Alexandra, Victoria. I'm half Australian/half British; because my dad moved to Australia from England before I was born. <br><br>
                            The only language I speak at home is English, I do know some Italian but not as much as I would like! <br>
                            Highschool was bad for me, I regret not putting in more effort, however I try my best to only look forwards when possible!<br><br>
                            Due to Depression and Anxiety, my life has been on hold for a very long time; but with me starting this course, along-side Intro to Programming - I'm taking back my life! <br><br>

                            I like to play video games of all varities; my favourite however is Destiny 2. <br>
                            Other than gaming, I really love to read and to draw stuff on my iPad. <br>
                            Drawing is one of my favourite ways to be creative! I love drawing from reference. <br><br>
                            I have 3 adorable cats named Ava, Lily and Madden. I also own a dog named Blink; after my favourite band Blink-182!<br><br>

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            <div class="info">
                            My interest in IT started when I was really little and my grandfather gifted me my first PC. He showed me what each part did and how they all work together. <br>
                            I remember that I would play Age of Empires on it all of the time and defintely got in some trouble for lacking on school work! <br><br>
                            My nan also had a bunch of learning games that me and my brother would play all of the time too, because as a child who cares that you're learning as long as it's fun right? <br><br>
                            Having always been my families go-to tech person, I've naturally over the years developed basic IT skills and exploring them more has been a goal that I've pushed aside for quite some time. Not anymore! My life is mine now. <br><br>
                            Studying at RMIT via OUA seemed like a really good option for me, as someone who's extremely shy and introverted, and my first couple of weeks studying have proven to me that
                            I am capable of doing this. <br>I will succeed! <br> I plan to finish this course along-side Intro to Programming and then go even further in my studies; doing Bachelor of IT. <br><br>
                            I am extremely excited to learn more about Cyber Security and Machine Learning! These areas interest me so much. I've watched countless videos on other people <br> exploring these 
                            areas and I cannot wait to do it myself. <br><br> I'm an overachiever who also hates everything that they do lmao. This website went through multiple layout changes and even now I'm undecided <br>
                            if I like it still, but I have study and other assignments to do. Bigger goals to achieve.

                                I like the results that I received because it speaks about being responsible and enjoying attempting to make things perfect. Creating this website is the perfect example of that for me! <br><br>
                                It also speaks about how intuitive my type is with other peoples emotions, and the ability to form strong bonds; despite being an introvert and all of my experieces so far make me believe that to be true. <br><br>
                                Noteable strengths are really supportive, reliable and observant; all of which I do identify with. I did do some thinking about my patience tolerance as it's supposed to be higher than what I know it is
                                self reflection is important to me and these test results have made me think a lot. <br>
                                Noteable weaknesses are shyness, taking things too personally and overloading myself; again, all of which I really identify with. <br><br>Going forward working in a team enviroment I'm defintely going to have to 
                                be cautious of my weaknesses and speak up for any help I need to overcome them.<br> I'd prefer a closeknit and supportive team enviroment to thrive and I do plan on doing my best to be a contributing factor to making that possible!<br>

                            <div class="info"><img src="learningstyle.png" alt="My results" style="width:200px;height:200px;margin-right:20px;">
                                <h2 style="color:rgb(128, 162, 163)">Learning Style</h2>
                                I had never done a test like this before and it was very insightful for me. I knew that people learn differently but had never questioned my own ability. <br>
                                Throughout schooling I defintely did notice that my learning was greater when I was up the front of the class, full attention and no one to distract me.<br><br>
                                This makes me wonder how group situations will go for me personally, in the case of other people messing around. I think I will personally step in and ask them to stop though. <br><br>
                                I hope I can also be a positive influence on other people's learning enviroments as well. I try to ask relevant questions when applicable, otherwise I doubt myself too much. Second guessing myself is one of my biggest flaws when it comes to schooling. I try my best to push through it though and defintely will continue to do so in group enviroments.<br><br>
                                Note taking, especially making it **pretty** is something I enjoy doing and I always make time each week to satisify this need. I feel like it helps me learn more; re-writing all of my notes, condensing them and sorting them how I like.<br>
                            </div>
                            <div class="info"><img src="thebig5.png" alt="My results" style="width:500px;height:200px;margin-right:20px;">
                                <h2 style="color:rgb(128, 162, 163)">The Big 5</h2>
                                I'll be honest, this test made me a bit sad to reflect on how Depression and Anxiety impacts my life and personality a ton. <br><br>
                                The test shines a light on agreeability as a good thing, which I do think it can be in small doses. I do fear however that I'm too much of a pushover. <br><br>
                                I am worried that this would reflect in my contribution to a team enviroment. For example: maybe someone speaks over me and I'm too shy to speak again or the group wants to go in a certain direction that I believe isnt the most efficient. <br><br>
                                I do try my best when I can to overcome these thoughts and feelings, but everyone has down days and this is again where I will need to reach out for support if I need it. I hopefully will be able to surround myself with a supportive team. <br><br>
                                All of these tests have been really insightful and though provoking. I know where I started before I took this giant step forward in my life and I do have an idea of where I want to end up. That excites me and gives me hope. <br>
