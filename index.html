                            Hello! My name is Michelle Towers, I'm 28 years old and I currently live in Bendigo, Australia. <br>
                            I was born in Alexandra, Victoria. I'm half Australian/half British; because my dad moved to Australia from England before I was born. <br><br>
                            The only language I speak at home is English, I do know some Italian but not as much as I would like! <br>
                            Highschool was bad for me, I regret not putting in more effort, however I try my best to only look forwards when possible!<br><br>
                            Due to Depression and Anxiety, my life has been on hold for a very long time; but with me starting this course, along-side Intro to Programming - I'm taking back my life! <br><br>

                            I like to play video games of all varities; my favourite however is Destiny 2. <br>
                            Other than gaming, I really love to read and to draw stuff on my iPad. <br>
                            Drawing is one of my favourite ways to be creative! I love drawing from reference. <br><br>
                            I have 3 adorable cats named Ava, Lily and Madden. I also own a dog named Blink; after my favourite band Blink-182!<br><br>

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            <div class="info">
                            My interest in IT started when I was really little and my grandfather gifted me my first PC. He showed me what each part did and how they all work together. <br>
                            I remember that I would play Age of Empires on it all of the time and defintely got in some trouble for lacking on school work! <br><br>
                            My nan also had a bunch of learning games that me and my brother would play all of the time too, because as a child who cares that you're learning as long as it's fun right? <br><br>
                            Having always been my families go-to tech person, I've naturally over the years developed basic IT skills and exploring them more has been a goal that I've pushed aside for quite some time. Not anymore! My life is mine now. <br><br>
                            Studying at RMIT via OUA seemed like a really good option for me, as someone who's extremely shy and introverted, and my first couple of weeks studying have proven to me that
                            I am capable of doing this. <br>I will succeed! <br> I plan to finish this course along-side Intro to Programming and then go even further in my studies; doing Bachelor of IT. <br><br>
                            I am extremely excited to learn more about Cyber Security and Machine Learning! These areas interest me so much. I've watched countless videos on other people <br> exploring these 
                            areas and I cannot wait to do it myself. <br><br> I'm an overachiever who also hates everything that they do lmao. This website went through multiple layout changes and even now I'm undecided <br>
                            if I like it still, but I have study and other assignments to do. Bigger goals to achieve.

                                I like the results that I received because it speaks about being responsible and enjoying attempting to make things perfect. This website is the perfect example of that for me! <br>
                                It also speaks about how intuitive my type is with other peoples emotions, and the aility to form strong bonds; despite being an introvert and all of my experieces so far make me believe that to be true. <br>
