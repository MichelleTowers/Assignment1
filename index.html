                                My name is Michelle Towers, I'm 28 years old and I currently live in Bendigo, Australia. I was born in Alexandra, Victoria. I'm half Australian/half British; because my dad moved to Australia from England before I was born. <br>
                                The only language I speak at home is English, I do know some Italian but not as much as I would like!<br><br>
                            <br><br>
                                High school was bad for me, I regret not putting in more effort, however, I try my best to only look forwards when possible!<br>
                                Due to Depression and Anxiety, my life has been on hold for a very long time; but with me starting this course, alongside Intro to Programming - I'm taking back my life!<br><br>
                            <br><br>
                            
                                I like to play video games of all varieties; my favourite however is Destiny 2. Other than gaming, I really love to read and draw stuff on my iPad. Drawing is one of my favourite ways to be creative! I love drawing from references. <br><br>
                            <br><br>
                                I have 3 adorable cats named Ava, Lily and Madden. I also own a dog named Blink; after my favourite band Blink-182! <br><br><br><br>
