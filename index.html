                            Hello! My name is Michelle Towers, I'm 28 years old and I currently live in Bendigo, Australia. <br>
                            I was born in Alexandra, Victoria. I'm half Australian/half British; because my dad moved to Australia from England before I was born. <br><br>
                            The only language I speak at home is English, I do know some Italian but not as much as I would like! <br>
                            Highschool was bad for me, I regret not putting in more effort, however I try my best to only look forwards when possible!<br><br>
                            Due to Depression and Anxiety, my life has been on hold for a very long time; but with me starting this course, along-side Intro to Programming - I'm taking back my life! <br><br>

                            I like to play video games of all varities; my favourite however is Destiny 2. <br>
                            Other than gaming, I really love to read and to draw stuff on my iPad. <br>
                            Drawing is one of my favourite ways to be creative! I love drawing from reference. <br><br>
                            I have 3 adorable cats named Ava, Lily and Madden. I also own a dog named Blink; after my favourite band Blink-182!<br><br>

                            Right: Lily <br><br>

                            Hello! My name is Michelle Towers, I'm 28 years old and I currently live in Bendigo, Australia. <br>
                            I like to play video games of all varities; my favourite however is Destiny 2. Other than gaming, I really love to read <br>

                            I have spent most of my life, from age 14 up not really caring about doing anything; from getting a job or even studying. <br>
                            Highschool was bad for me, I regret not putting in more effort, however I try my best to only look forwards when possible! <br>
                            Anxiety and Depression have taken it's toll over the years; however starting this course alongside Intro to Programming is my way of taking back my life. <br>
                            <br>
                            I want to do something, anything, and I know starting in a field I really enjoy to begin with is going to help me <br>
                            I intend to go on after these 2 courses and start Bachelors of IT. I hope I get there! â™¥
